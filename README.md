Sugar
=====

Sugar is the core component of a worldwide effort to provide every
child with equal opportunity for a quality education. Available in
more than twenty-five languages, Sugarâ€™s Activities are used every
school day by nearly three million children in more than forty
countries.

Originally developed for the One Laptop per Child XO-1 netbook, Sugar
runs on most computers. Sugar is free/libre and open-source software.

**This is a fork of the Sugar Desktop used for testing purposes as a part of the Sugar Listens GSoC 2014 project.**

Setup and Run
==============

1. Make **sure** Sugar Listens is already running, otherwise things will go boom! (I warned you).
If you haven't installed Sugar Listens yet, check [this](https://github.com/rparrapy/sugarlistens/blob/master/README.md) out. 
2. If you are using the sugar-build tool for running Sugar, copy the *extensions/deviceicon/speech* folder and its content to *build/out/install/share/sugar/extensions/deviceicon/speech*.
3. Run Sugar as you usually would.
4. Say "Start Maze" and let the magic happen (Disclaimer: Maze Activity should be installed for this to work).
